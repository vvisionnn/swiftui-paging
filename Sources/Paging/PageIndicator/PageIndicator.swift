import SwiftUI

/// A control that displays a horizontal series of dots, each of which corresponds to a page.
///
/// When a user taps a page indictor to move to the next or previous page, the control updates the selection
/// binding. A user can also drag along the indicator to move between pages.
///
/// ```swift
/// @State private var selection = 0
///
/// var body: some View {
///     PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: total)
///     Text("Current Page: \(selection)")
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ![PageIndicator on iOS](PageIndicator)
///
/// ## Styling
///
/// You can set the tint color of the indicator by using the built-in view modifiers:
///
/// ```swift
/// PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: total)
///     .pageIndicatorCurrentColor(.purple)
///     .pageIndicatorColor(.purple.opacity(0.3))
/// ```
///
/// ![PageIndicator on iOS with customised tint colors](PageIndicator-colors)
///
/// The background and color scheme of the indicator can also be set like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: total)
///     .pageIndicatorBackgroundStyle(.prominent)
///     .colorScheme(.dark)
/// ```
///
/// ## Indicator Icons
///
/// You can customise an indicator's icon to denote special pages, such as how the Weather app uses the
/// first page to represent the user's current location:
///
/// ![PageIndicator on iOS with customised icon](PageIndicator-icons)
///
/// Icon customisations are provided in the form of a view builder passed to the
/// ``PageIndicator/init(selection:total:icons:)`` initialiser.
/// The first parameter represents the page index and the second the selected state. Here's an example that
/// replaces the first page with a location symbol:
///
/// ```swift
/// PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: total) { (page, selected) in
///     if page == 0 {
///         Image(systemName: "location.fill")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Here's how you might vary the icon depending on the currently selected page:
///
/// ```swift
/// PageIndicator(selection: $selection, total: total) { (page, selected) in
///     if selected {
///         Image(systemName: "folder.fill")
///     } else {
///         Image(systemName: "folder")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Page Progress
///
/// A page indicator can automatically advance to the next page after a set duration.
///
/// ```swift
/// PageIndicator...
///     .pageIndicatorDuration(3.0)
/// ```
/// This can also be used to drive a ``PageView`` if the selection binding is shared between the two views.
///
